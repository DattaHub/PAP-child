## Repository for the Little Rock child maltreatment project. 

This repository will be used to store and distribute the reports and methods 
for the different analyses performed for child maltreatment project in LR, 
along with some of the source codes. 


## Exploratory Analysis 

This report contains the following. 
Basic spatial maps and kernel density heatmaps for reported incidents, their time distribution, and correlation structure 
for both built environment factors and census variables. It also has a short report on finding sub-categories of child maltreatment 
showing stronger association structures (association rules) that are uncovered by a frequent itemset analysis.
